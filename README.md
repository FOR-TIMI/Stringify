# Stringify

This project just solves some coding problems that i encountered while learning to code and how i solved them.

FizzBuzz
- FizzBuzz takes a number.
- Checks if it is divisible by only three. if so it prints 'fizz'
- Checks if it is divisible by three and five. if so it prints 'fizzbuzz'
- Checks if it is divisible by five. if so it prints 'buzz'

Vowels
-it takes in a string and then extracts all the vowels if there are vowels
-if not it returns an error message 'There are no vowels in the string'

Expand
-it takes in a string and counts the number of occurrence on every string
 for example
 expand('aaaligator') will return 'a4l1i1g1t1o1r1'
 
 Reverse
 -it takes a String and reverses it
 for example
 reverse('aaaligator') will return "rotagilaaa"
 
 Palindrome
 -it takes a string and returns true if when read, it is the same backward as forward,
 
 for example palindrome('A dog! A panic in a pagoda.') will return true && palindrome('not a palindrome') will return false
